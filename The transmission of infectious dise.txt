The transmission of infectious diseases is rarely independent, with another disease often shaping overall health outcomes in vulnerable populations. In regional Australian towns, distinct demographic factors may alter the dynamics of HIV/AIDS and Influenza. The project investigates both the epidemiology of both HIV and Influenza in a regional Australian town. Computational epidemiology is used to simulate a disease spread within the Australian town of Bourke with about 2400 individuals. (Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2021).

The project aims to quantify how HIV-induced immunosuppression modifies influenza transmission, prevalence and overall disease burden, with other factors such as demographic and public health responses in rural Australia. 

A computational epidemiological model was developed using Python and NetworkX to generate a contact network reflective of Bourke’s demographic — namely age structure, gender distribution and Indigenous proportion (30.3%). Population nodes were assigned to demographic attributes and initial infection states, with sexual relationships formed with age and monogamy constraints.

HIV and influenza transmission probabilities were estimated from other studies with influenza being modelled as a fast-spreading disease with higher severity in immunocompromised hosts. 

Results show distinct patterns between both diseases. HIV prevalence rose gradually across the simulation, reflecting slow person-to-person sexual transmission. In contrast, influenza displayed a sharp epidemic curve, peaking in a short time, before declining, reflective of recovery dynamics. Influenza incidence hit the total population, highlighting that nearly all individuals were exposed. The presence of influenza amplified HIV transmission in the model, by about 30%, leading to faster epidemic spread. 

The findings suggest that co-dynamics between the two diseases could significantly burden small regional towns. The model demonstrates the value of computational simulations in capturing disease interactions within realistic demographic structures. While preliminary, the results highlight the importance of tailored public health strategies in regional Australian contexts. Future work will refine the network with a more realistic approach, considering healthcare and to test interventions to reduce epidemic spread.
